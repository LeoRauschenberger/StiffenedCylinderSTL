Stiffened Cylinder for 3D-printing

These are two experimental lightweight design stiffened cylinders to test the limits of what is 3D-printable. A mayor issue I encountered with the slicer Cura is stitching. I therefore designed this as two cylinders (inner and outer), which are so close to each other that they will fuse together in the print, but be seen as separate parts in Cura.

For this print, you must use a 0,2 mm nozzle!
